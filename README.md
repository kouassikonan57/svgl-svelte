## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, visuals play a crucial role in user experience. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) offers a versatile way to include images that scale beautifully across devices. Our **svgl-svelte** package provides a curated selection of SVG logos, optimized for use in Svelte applications. 

You can find the latest releases [here](https://github.com/kouassikonan57/svgl-svelte/releases). Be sure to download the latest version and follow the installation steps below.

## Installation

To get started with **svgl-svelte**, you need to install it via npm. Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install svgl-svelte
```

This command will add the package to your project, making it easy to import and use the SVG logos.

## Usage

Using the SVG logos in your Svelte components is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to integrate an SVG logo into your project:

```svelte
<script>
  import Logo from 'svgl-svelte/Logo.svelte';
</script>

<main>
  <h1>Welcome to My Svelte App!</h1>
  <Logo />
</main>
```

In this example, replace `Logo` with the name of the SVG file you wish to use. The component will render the SVG logo directly in your application.

### Customization

You can customize the SVG logos with props. For instance, you can change the size or color of the logo by passing attributes:

```svelte
<Logo width="100" height="100" fill="blue" />
```

This allows you to tailor the appearance of each logo to fit your design needs.
